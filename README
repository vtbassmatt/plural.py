plural.py

An implementation of Mozilla's plural forms* in Python.

*Except rule 12, which differs in word order from Mozilla.

Usage:

  import plural
  
  translations = ("bird", "birds")
  singular = plural.pluralize(translations, 1, rulefor("en"))
  print "There is one {0}".format(singular)
  
  print "plural.py expects the following translations for Irish Gaeilge:"
  print plural.explain(rulefor("ga"))



To make pluralservice work, Flask must be installed:

- install VirtualEnv (sudo easy_install virtualenv)
- create an environment (virtualenv env)
- switch to the environment (. env/bin/activate)
- install Flask (easy_install Flask)

The URLs are:
  http://server/language/{langcode} - rulefor(langcode)
  http://server/rule/{rule}         - explain(rule)
  http://server/pluralize           - pluralize()

Pluralize expects the following query parameters:
  w: a word form, such as "bird" or "birds" (repeated as many times as needed)
  c: count, the number of "w" requested
  r: rule, the rule to apply

Given that English is rule 1 (you can discover this by calling the /language/ service),
requesting the translation for 2 birds would be:
  http://server/pluralize?w=bird&w=birds&c=2&rule=1

And the response would be:
  {"count": 2, "word": "birds", "rule": 1}

Errors are reported by nulling the response value and including an error string:
  {"count": 2, "word": null, "rule": 42, "error": "Invalid rule specified"}
